            To be real, this section was the hardest part of building the
            website 😅
        </p>
        <p>
            Coming to me — I started my programming journey in 2020 after my
            10th. Currently, Im mostly into Linux and have started learning
            Rust. One of the main problems I have is that everything looks
            interesting to me! I've explored almost every domain including
            AI/ML, GPU programming , building small games 🎮, web dev 🌐, and
            mobile dev— except crypto (someday I need to 😅).

            Linux and me: (this needs a separate section) — my Linux journey
            started in early 2024 when I first installed Pop!_OS. But fate had
            other plans, and despite many efforts, I couldnt get sound working
            on Pop!_OS (it was working fine on Ubuntu tho 😩). Around the same
            time, one of my friends started using Arch with a Hyprland setup — It was cool. I wanted to try Hyprland but didnt wanted the
            complexity, so after going through the Hyprland docs, I ended up
            choosing NixOS (this made me question my reading skills 💀). It
            wasnt *that* hard — I have my custom rice now (links down) — but
            currently Im back to Pop!_OS (yeah, now sound got fixed). Not
            because it was hard, but I couldnt handle the extra overhead due to
            personal reasons. I still use the Nix package manager and Ill be
            back to Nix once everything settles ✌️.

            Apart from coding — what else? Hardcore Minecraft fan (but rarely
            play tho) ⛏️; cat lover (believe me, if u dont have a cat, youve
            missed a lot in life 🐱). I dont usually watch movies, but if you
            find anything cool or interesting, just share — Ill watch/listen 😄.
            If you ever feel like sharing something, feel free to DM me anytime
            (ik how it can make a big difference at the right time 🤍).
